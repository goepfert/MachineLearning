Some examples with increasing complexity to demonstrate the functionality of tensorflow.

Purpose in all examples is one dimensional fit to some generated 2d data points in x-y-plane.

Examples need to be commented in/out in index.html.

## Superclean

Straight line fit with self defined loss function.

## Regression

Same as superclean but with nices user interface.

## Regression with real network

Using dense network. Check difference when using:
- one layer, one node, no activation
- one layer, one node, with activation
- \>=1 layer, >=1 node per layer
