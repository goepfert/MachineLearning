# Playground

Testing the simple self written network

- only one hidden layer
- fully connected
- activation function: sigmoid
- stochastic gradient descent (no batch learning)

Parameters

_to be edited in the code_

- number of hidden nodes
- learning rate
- number of training iterations, total and after how many the graph/canvas shall be updated

## Task

Classify two inputs of a given distribution and visualize the result:

- Loss function of current training step
- Prediction of continuous 2d inputs (scan of values in the canvas)

## Distributions

1. XOR

The edges of the canvas correspond to [0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1] and [1, 1].

2. Random

A fixed number of data points will be generated randomly.

3. Spiral

A fixed number of data points will be generated in a spiral shape.
